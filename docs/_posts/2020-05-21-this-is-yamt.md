description: "Welcome to ScaMPI - the forgotten scaffolder."

During my PhD, I had the privilege to work with
[Elisa Corteggiani](https://www.elisacorteggiani.com). She started studing the genetic and biochemical
properties of *Nannochloropsis gaditana*, a promising source of biofuel (at least at the time, circa 2010),
and planned to do the whole genome sequencing and assembly.

Both 454 FLX libraries and long mate paired libraries (SOLiD) were sequences, but the lack of a scaffolding
program properly supporting color space mate paired libraries was a problem. So I wrote ScaMPI, a suite of
tools to automatically and manually (!) scaffold the genome.

* Code is in the [ScaMPI repository](https://github.com/telatin/scampi), for archival purposes **only**.
